      <description>Italy v Switzerland Italy are through with yet another 3-0 win in a dominant showing. Locatelli becoming the first Italian since Balotelli to score a brace in the Euros which capped off a great performance from the youngster. Immobile capped it off with a brilliant goal as well</description>

      <description>Hungary v Portugal I HAVE NO PITY TOWARDS HUNGARY. God, this game was hard to watch. Portugal were frustrated heavily by Hungary who were ultra defensive(Can give Jose a run for his money) and Jota can&amp;rsquo;t even play properly as he missed a golden chance to give the ball to CR7 and took on the shot himself. I swear the game was better when Andre Silva came on. Renato Sanches as well was a star turn as they were a breath of fresh air and capitalised on a tiring Hungary.</description>

      <description>Finland v Russia Russia Domination overall. Finland did get an early chance with Pohjanpalo scoring but it was ruled out due to offside. Finally before halftime, Miranchuk scored a brilliant goal past Hradecky to get the winner. After that, a brilliant performance from Hradecky kept the score at 1-0.
Turkey v Wales Turkey were incredibly wasteful. Ramsey put Wales in front before half time. Turkey had a few good chances but the best one was put over by Yilmaz when he was right before the goal.</description>

      <description>Netherlands v Ukraine What a thriller for the Dutch on their return to a major tounrament. First Half was all square. The second half saw a few openings and Wijnaldum scored first capitalising on the rebound from the initial save. Then, Weghorst scored although may be a foul but it was given anyway. Then the comeback happened first via a SCREAMER from Yarmolenko in the top bin and then with a header from a set piece(Maybe could be the Dutch&amp;rsquo;s undoing in this tourney).</description>

      <description>Belgium v Russia This was another easy match I feel. Belgium did amazing. Lukaku strong contender for the Golden Boot. First goal was unlucky since the defender&amp;rsquo;s touch nullified the offside against Lukaku. Second one was a rebound and a good goal from Meunier. The last goal was a mere formality from Lukaku. Belgium Looking Strong.
England v Croatia An utter BOREFEST. I get that you need to defend the lead but COME ON.</description>

      <description>Italy v Turkey This was inevitable. Italy just dominated. Unfortunate that the first goal was an own goal(2018 vibes anyone?). Italy could&amp;rsquo;ve had around 4 or maybe 5. The remaining 2 were easy. Immobile scoring in the rebound and Insigne curling an absolute beauty.
Wales v Switzerland Pretty good watch actually. The Welsh striker was alone mostly since Switzerland were dominating in attack. The first goal was deserved but they could&amp;rsquo;ve perhaps scored a few other chances.</description>
