<p>A brilliant thriller from Poland on their last match. Sweden played well and their position in the group has given them a favourable match in the Round of 16 but it may be challenging for them. An early goal from Forsberg gave them the lead with a great finish on his left. Lewa had a chance in the first chance to get back in it when his first header hit the post and he hit the post again on the rebound. The second half was where the match really lit up Forsberg scoring again to double the lead but Lewandowski scored two great goals to bring Poland level(Could have had a hat trick if he scored that header). Finally Sweden punished Poland and scored in stoppage time to send Poland out.</p>
<h2 id="slovakia-v-spain">Slovakia v Spain</h2>
<p><img src="../1f76ab2d97c5435e90cec44d4a20b662.png" alt="4c35312b536bc0fd7bd65f850089de47.png"></p>
<p>Spain finally have found form. I wouldn&rsquo;t say the same for Morata nor Moreno. Slovakia were absolutely awful with no shots at all in the first half. Dubravka was a major hero in the first 25 minutes saving a penalty from Morata making it the 5th penalty miss from Spain but unfortunately he managed to score an own goal when he weakly punched a high ball into his own net(What is with amazing goalkeepers having a crap game to finish the tournament). Towards the end of the first half, Laporte managed to score his first ever goal for his new country after switching from France with a looping header. Sarabia was amazing throughout and scored in the second half and assisted substitute Ferran Torres who made the quickest impact in this Euros with a brilliant goal. Then finally another own goal(8 now for the tournament). One thing that was evident was Busquets' stability when he was present.</p>
<h2 id="germany-v-hungary">Germany v Hungary</h2>

<p>Thank god we don&rsquo;t need to see Hungary anymore after this. That loss to Portugal made the difference since this was a draw as well. It was actually Hungary who scored first surprisingly. Havertz managed to equalise only in the second half. Hungary scored again after taking advantage of some sloppy defending. Finally Goretzka managed to salvage a point after a great finish from range.</p>
<h2 id="france-v-portugal">France v Portugal</h2>
<p><img src="../a602ae4f38a2463e8744f91db67f00c5.png" alt="3b24d81f20f7ffb119451ce6fd0d2fec.png"></p>
<p>Great effort from Portugal making it through as one of the best third placed teams. This was a major penalty palooza with Ronaldo first scoring from the spot and then Benzema scoring another penalty before half time. The next goal he scored however was in open play. Next, Ronaldo again scored another penalty to level it and Rui Patricio made sure it would stay that way after a round of great saves. This record is now equalled by Ronaldo. The man is a machine</p>
