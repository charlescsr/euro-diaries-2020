<p>I guess you could say this was a moral victory for Scotland given their history. They frustrated England well along with England themselves being wasteful in the rainy pitch. The fans booing didn&rsquo;t help(At least there was no reason to play the song now heh. For reference: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJqimlFcJsM)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJqimlFcJsM)</a>. Scotland had a few decent chances from Che Adams but that was it. Foden missed again, Kane missed, Stones hit the post, Everything went wrong for them in this derby.</p>
<h2 id="hungary-v-france">Hungary v France</h2>
<p><img src="../80e4314df9cc4f8ba877a46ed6e5292c.png" alt="2b2bfff4ffcb87b2043d0825c9ad647a.png"></p>
<p>Hungary did well. Gulacsi was the undoubtful hero for them. Kudos on that. As for France(WORLD CHAMPIONS BTW), they were immensely wasteful. Mbappe and headers do not go well. Greizmann missed an easy chance with the goal gaping open after Gulacsi&rsquo;s initial save. Hungary got the first goal however when the defenders did not close down Fiola who scored and gave the celebration of the season. Greizmann later made amends in the second half with an almost similar situation(Open goal again I mean). France could not capitalise on their first win. They have to win against Portugal which is painful to admit here as someone who wants to see Ronaldo do well and based on the next result.</p>
<h2 id="portugal-v-germany">Portugal v Germany</h2>
<p><img src="../187fd19a270b46bca35cf4f2ffe59eaf.png" alt="7f6879b6ddc808146bf19c6ce740586c.png"></p>
<p>ABSOLUTE DOMINATION AGAIN. The Portugal defence absolutely crumbled against a German attack and Gosens was at the heart of everything. Semedo got caught out by Gosens repeatedly. Portugal took the lead with a brilliant counter-attack starting from Bernardo Silva&rsquo;s pass to Jota who had the brain to pass to Ronaldo who scored. Then, the cookie crumbled so to say. 2 own goals(yes, that&rsquo;s 2 own goals) which meant this tournament has the highest own goals ever in any Euros. After the 2 OG&rsquo;s, Havertz scored and Gosens capped a brilliant performance from him. Jota finally scored another consolation goal after a cross back from Ronaldo. I&rsquo;m interested to see how Germany v Hungary shapes up. The former have hit form, the latter have frustrated everyone so far.</p>
