<p>I HAVE NO PITY TOWARDS HUNGARY. God, this game was hard to watch. Portugal were frustrated heavily by Hungary who were ultra defensive(Can give Jose a run for his money) and Jota can&rsquo;t even play properly as he missed a golden chance to give the ball to CR7 and took on the shot himself. I swear the game was better when Andre Silva came on. Renato Sanches as well was a star turn as they were a breath of fresh air and capitalised on a tiring Hungary. The first came from Guerreiro which took a massive deflection. Then a penalty from CR7 made him the first person to score in 5 European Competitions. The third goal was truly a chef&rsquo;s kiss. A brilliant one-two with Rafa Silva and Ronaldo rounded the keeper before finishing the goal off. Hungary did get a goal before all this carnage but it was disallowed for offside which was hilarious.</p>
<h2 id="france-v-germany">France v Germany</h2>
<p><img src="../61606f8b16074bad9e8f49f27ecf4b6a.png" alt="bf7881240934834da5052e3e3ad40a2e.png"></p>
<p>This was dominated by France but only one goal to show for it. Germany hardly had any clear chances. Gnabry was alone(Why did he play ST when he plays RW. Just Low things) The lone goal was a Hummels OG. Feel sad for him after he made a comeback for this tournament. Two goals were disallowed. Both for offside. Mbappe netted a beauty and set up Benzema before both of them were disallowed.</p>
