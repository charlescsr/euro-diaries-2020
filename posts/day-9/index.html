<p>Morata and Moreno made Szczesny look good along with his amazing saves too. Morata missed a few chances before he did score which was given a scare when it was ruled out for offside but was overturned by VAR. Spain were then wasteful. This turned up the pressure and Poland equalised in the second half from none other than Lewandowski. Laporte with a school boy error who got easily pushed by Lewa before heading it in. A later penalty from Spain was missed by Moreno and Morata fluffed the rebound(Can no one in the Spain forward line actually score??). This is making me wonder: Are they missing the leadership and experience of Ramos here?</p>
<h2 id="italy-v-wales">Italy v Wales</h2>
<p><img src="../749c792d086c45cf9fc661ef1eb13488.png" alt="e918ea213a5a307b0e37d11323f8aba8.png"></p>
<p>Wales did lose but both teams made it through. Italy were the threatening side despite making major rotations since they were already through. Finally a low freekick from Verrati was edged inside by Pessina. Chiesa was super super threatening in thw whole game. Later, a straight red was given to Ampadu for something that was not a high challenge. Wales were done dirty by this since it was a yellow at best. They still managed to hold on thanks to Ward&rsquo;s keeping. Wales could&rsquo;ve equalised if Bale who was in space kept his shot down on the volley. Italy could go semis is my prediction. Wales R16 at best.</p>
<h2 id="switzerland-v-turkey">Switzerland v Turkey</h2>
<p><img src="../943d8629ca5e4e089760e28707a69384.png" alt="446dd045318ea1af27d4b66c640f90dd.png"></p>
<p>A game of great goals all round. It started off with a beauty from Seferovic. Then Shaqiri made it 2 with a beautiful weak foot shot. Then Turkey pulled one back after Sommer denied them the whole match till that point. The goal was unexpected but a banger. Then finally Switzerland sealed it from Shaqiri who was picked out by Zuber brilliantly. Their fate will be decided by the other 3rd best teams. Until then, WELL DONE BAKU.</p>
